# Definator

## Plan and description

With **Definator** you will be able to quickly save terms and write up
definition for them. It will support cross-referencing the terms and also attachment
of files to a term. It is a plan to save the data in such a form, that a definition project can be
browsed in a web browser. It is will use
[PyQt 5](http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/intro)
and
[Qt 5](http://qt-project.org/qt5).
The definition area is planned to be implemented using
[Qt WebKit](http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-5/qtwebkit-index.html)
module.  App is developed on linux and as such it should be simplest to run on linux. Binaries for different operation
systems could be achieved by using
[pyqtdeploy](http://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqtdeploy/),
which will be looked into at some point.

## Licensing

**Definator** is licensed **[GPLv3](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.txt)**, which
is in line with the [Qt 5](http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-5/licensing.html) and [PyQt 5](http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/license) licensing options.

## Context

The app is developed as a part of
[graphical UI programming course TIEA212](http://appro.mit.jyu.fi/gko/) (2014)
at the University of Jyväskylä. It is also developed to scratch an itch to have
this kind of a tool at hand, to learn python, to learn qt and for fun.

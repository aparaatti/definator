# Definator


With Definator you will be able to quickly save terms and write up definition
for them. It should support cross referencing the terms and also enable
attaching media to the definition texts. It is also a plan to save the data in
such a form, that a definition project can be also browsed in a web browser. It
is supposed to use [PyQt 5](http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/intro), [Qt 5](http://qt-project.org/qt5) and the definition area is planned to be
implemented using [Qt WebKit](http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-5/qtwebkit-index.html) module.  App is mainly developed on linux and as
such it should be simplest to run on linux.


Definator is licensed **[GPLv3](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.txt)** which
is in line with the Qt 5 and PyQt 5 licensing options.

The app is developed as a part of a
[graphical UI programming course TIEA212](http://appro.mit.jyu.fi/gko/) (2014)
at the University of Jyväskylä. It is also developed to scratch an itch and for
fun.

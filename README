<h1>Definator</h1>

<p>With Definator you will be able to quickly save terms and write up definition for them. It should support cross referencing the terms and also enable attaching media to the definition texts. It is also a plan to save the data in such a form, that a definition project can be also browsed in a web browser. It is supposed to use pyQt 5, Qt 5 and the definition area is planned to be implemented using Qt WebKit module.  App is mainly developed on linux and as such it should be simplest to run on linux.</p>

<p>
Definator is licensed <a href="">GPLv3</a> which is in line with the Qt 5 and PyQt 5 licensing options.</p>

<p>
The app is developed as a part of graphical GUI programming course <a href="">http://appro.mit.jyu.fi/gko/ TIEA212</a> (2014) at the University of Jyväskylä. It is also developed for the sake of scratching of an own itch and for fun.
